#### Description:

When Knuth asked professional programmers at top companies like IBM to implement an efficient algorithm for binary search with duplicates, 90% of them had bugs â€” year after year. Indeed, although the binary search algorithm was first published in 1946, the first bug-free algorithm for binary search with duplicates was published only in 1962!
